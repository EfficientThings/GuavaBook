A Big(CM4)-Little(emacsOS) based laptop

VERY work in progress...

Think chromebook(but not necesarily running ChromeOS), but with a mechanical keyboard(kailh choco), 4k display, intearnal SSD and rtlSDR, and fully open source. Desighned to run an ultralight emacsOS for low power mode or just because. Fanless cooling of CM4 allows for completely silent operation and complete lack of adhesives makes the device fully repairable!
